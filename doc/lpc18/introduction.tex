 \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Software Defined Networking (SDN)~\cite{rfc7426} decouples the network
control-plane from the data-plane.  Open Flow~\cite{mckeown-ccr08} is
a typical incarnation of SDN.  Even though SDN makes the control-plane
programmable, it still assumes that the {data-plane} is fixed.  The
inability to program data-planes is a significant impediment to
innovation: for example, the deployment of the VxLAN
protocol~\cite{rfc7348} took 4 years between the initial proposal and
its commercial availability in high-speed devices.

\cite{bosshart-ccr14} proposed the P4 language: Programming
Protocol-independent Packet Processors, which is designed to make the
behavior of \emph{data-planes} expressible as software.  P4 has gained
rapid adoption.  The p4.org consortium~\cite{p4org} was created to
steward the language evolution; p4.org currently includes more than
100 organizations in the areas of networking, cloud systems, network
chip design, and academic institutions.  The P4 specification is open
and public~\cite{p416-spec17}.  Reference implementations for
compilers, simulation and debugging tools are available with a
permissive license at the GitHub P4 repository~\cite{p4lang}.  While
initially P4 was designed for programming network switches, its scope
has been broadened to cover a large variety of packet-processing
systems (e.g., network cards, FPGAs, etc.).
